# Intro
Portfolio showcasing coding projects developed by Cooper Hepworth.

## About Me
My name is Cooper S. Hepworth. I am an aspiring data analyst with a background based in software engineering and analytics.

I am happily married. My wife and I have three kids. The oldest, Patton, is five-years-old and is obsessed with letters and numbers. The youngest two are twins, three-years-old, their names are Willow, who loves dolls, and Fletcher who loves dinosaurs.

My wife and I are both Idaho natives. We love enjoying the beautiful outdoors of our state and taking our kids wherever we can. We enjoy going to the mountains, camping, and spending time with our extended families.

## About this portfolio
Projects contained within this portfolio include:

### WGU Capstone Project
https://github.com/CSHepworth/Portfolio/tree/main/WGU-Capstone-Project

Capstone project for completing my Bachelor's degree in Data Analytics. It investigates Formula One racing data over the past 75 years and compares driver and contructor times to determine which has a greater impact on race performance. This project incorporated data manipulation and cleaning with python, data analysis through aggregation and generation of charts, and generating a mixed effects model via R.

### Unsupervised Project
https://github.com/CSHepworth/Portfolio/blob/main/Unsupervised%20Project/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb

Final project for the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree. Includes the importation and cleaning of a massive dataset via Python. Data had to be cleaned and analyzed programmatically. All cleaning operations are stored in functions for reusablility. Using Sci-Kit Learn, unsupervised machine learning analysis was conducted on the data.
